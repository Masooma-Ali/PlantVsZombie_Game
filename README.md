This is a simplified version of the popular Plants vs Zombies game developed as a group project using C++ with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
We used the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to handle graphics and real-time user interaction.
The game involves placing plants to defend a garden from waves of attacking zombies.
